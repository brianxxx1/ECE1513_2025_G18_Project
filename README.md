# ECE1513_2025_G18_Project

This project is part of the ECE1513 course for the 2025 academic year, undertaken by Group 18. The repository includes implementations of various machine learning algorithms, such as K-Means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Variational Autoencoders (VAE).

## Overview

This project is focused on the implementation of machine learning algorithms, including:

- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering data.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A method for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving as much variance as possible.
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**: A deep learning model used for unsupervised learning and generative tasks.

The repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for these implementations.

## Project Structure

The repository consists of the following key files:

- `K-Means.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation and application of the K-Means clustering algorithm.
- `pca_implementation.py`: A Python script that provides an implementation of Principal Component Analysis.
- `vae.py`: A Python script that contains the code for building and training a Variational Autoencoder.
- `ae.py`: A Python script that includes the implementation of an Autoencoder.
- `print_recovered_pca.py`: A Python script that visualizes the data reconstructed using PCA.
